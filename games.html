  <h3>Have you heard the good news?? </h3>
<p>
Recently, our Editor Nikki was able to get ahold of two packs from the recent
<i>Shmine: The Gathering</i> set <i>Shmines of Ruquosquak</i>. If you aren't familiar
with our Earthly equivalent <i> Magic: The Gathering</i>, it's a card game where
you duke it out with all sorts of creatures, sorceries, and enchantments,
all flavorfully crafted to tell the story found in <i>Magic</i>'s decades worth of lore.
This story is released in small sets of like-themed cards. </p>
<p> In recent years, Wizards of the Coast has released a number of sets from
well known IP's such as Lord of the Rings, Doctor Who, Warhammer 40k, and so on.
What many of the most seasoned <i>Magic</i> players might not know is that <i>Wizards</i> have
long since been releasing parallel sets through their subsidiary <i>Shmines of the Coast</i>,
and as a result, our friends in Shmineland have been keeping pace with their own decades of
unique lore and such for about as long as we have! In a similar vein to the Universes Beyond
sets here, <i>Shmines</i> has been releasing more history-themed sets, like the one we're looking at today.
</p>
<p> <i>Shmines of Ruquosquak</i> takes a dive into the history of the first true planet-wide
  Shminian conflict against the Schwabs. Many keen eyed players will recognize scenes like
   Duckard's Big Swipe, or the Betrayal of Awh'Gawban, in the backgrounds of some cards. This barely
   scratches the surface of historicity in this set, though.
 </p>
<p>In the coming weeks we'll be breaking
   down some of the deepest cuts in this set's lore, so keep an eye out, and in the meantime, take
    a gander at the Gallery for a look at some of the cards from this set! <br><br>
    Until next time,<br>-Timmy Stolkenheimer

  Recently on my trip to Shmineland I picked up the game Rise of the Dead HD (the HD remake of a beautiful game). In this game you travel across Ruquosquak defending yourself from the undead and learning the secrets behind the chemical war that led to the outbreak. The remake also includes all of the DLC that went along with the game. This includes: Mission: Blizziard Island!, Retake Cannon Island, and Journey to the Moons of Ruquosquak!. The game also includes up to 8 players fighting against hordes of the undead over the internet.
  <br><br>
  below is the box-art for Rise of the Dead HD for the Akofee X HD.
