  Long ago, on the planet Ruquosquak, there lived a race of intelligent avian-humanoids known as the Shmines. The Shmines are the result of a planet covered mostly in birds and other earth-like species of animals being struck by a large meteor that shook the planet with such a force that it caused the landscape to completely change. This event is known as the Great Rebirth. Inside of the meteor was a type of alien virus that infected the birds of the planet, accelerating the evolution process, and within about 10,000 years the animals of the primitive Ruquosquak were no more. There were only the intelligent race of Shmines.</p>

<p>
  Most of the time when a person is referring to the Shmines, they think of bird-men. Though this is true for a majority of the Shmines, not all Shmines are descendants of birds. In fact we have a list of different Shmine species here _______. To give you a comparison to go by, imagine that the bird-Shmines are like white people on Earth. Other species of Shmines are like black colored people, because many people believe that both are less developed and less intelligent. Though other species of Shmines may be less evolved, the majority of them are actually on par with bird-Shmines in terms of brain power.
</p>
<p>
  After the Great Rebirth of Ruquosquak, Birds began to evolve into a more humanoid shape, learned to use tools, created large communities, organized religion, invented new things, etc. Similar to how the humans developed, only slightly faster due to the Great Rebirth causing lots of minerals that are vital to the Shmines development being either scattered or buried, which required the Shmines to learn faster in order to procure these minerals.
